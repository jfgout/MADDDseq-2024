Data from the MADDD-seq pipeline

In the R scripts, the line that says:
# BD_DATA <- "C:/lab/TR_ERRORS/Projects/YeastMNNG-XP/Jason/data/2022-04-NewPipeLine/yeast"

should be updated to point to the folder where this archive is extracted.

There is one sub-folder per sample. For each sample, the most important files are:

* max_variants_2.adduct.gtf : A GTF file with the location (and details) about each adduct called by the pipepline
* max_variants_2.DSC.vcf.gz : A VCF (Variant Call File) with information about mutations called.
* coverage.rds : pre-computed coverage information in binary format to be loaded in R.
